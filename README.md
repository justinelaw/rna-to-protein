# Translating RNA Into Protein
Problem from Rosalind.info - *https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/*

## Overview
There exists 20 commonly occurring amino acids, and they are denoted by 20 letter of the English alphabet, with the exceptions of letters B, J, O, U, X, and Z. We are tasked to transcribe an RNA-sequence into a protein string, formed by these 20 letters.
